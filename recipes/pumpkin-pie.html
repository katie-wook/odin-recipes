        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pumpkin pie is a given for any Thanksgiving dessert selection, but that doesn't mean it can't be improved. Whipping up a light and fluffy vanilla meringue to top this delicious pie is sure to wow your Thanksgiving guests. Toasting the meringue with a chef's torch will give your pie some extra color and lovely marshmallow smell. This decadent treat will please in both taste and presentation this holiday season.</p>
        <p>This pie will take a bit longer to make than the average pumpkin pie, since meringue is a step up from whipped cream. But most of the work can be handled by a stand mixer, leaving you to take a break or work on other menu items. This is still a relatively effortless recipe that's sure to wow, and as always, is best served fresh out of the oven.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Pumpkin Pie</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (9-inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Vanilla Meringue</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>5 large egg whites</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and place it on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Combine pumpkin puree, condensed milk, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl; mix until combined. Pour into the pie crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until filling is set, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool completely.</li>
            <li>Place the sugar, egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in the top pan of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl set over a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan filled with a few inches of simmering water (be sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water).</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat, using a heatproof rubber spatula to stir the mixture and scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the sugar is completely melted and the candy thermometer inserted in the center of the mixture reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Immediately pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on low for 1 minute, then increase the speed to medium-high and whisk for 10 minutes, or until stiff, glossy peaks form and the sides of the bowl should feel cool to touch. Add the vanilla and mix on medium-low speed until combined.</li>
            <li>Use immediately by scooping the meringue over the pumpkin pie. Use a chef's torch to toast the meringue and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
