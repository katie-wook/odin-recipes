        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pumpkin pie is a given for any Thanksgiving dessert selection, but that doesn't mean it can't be improved. Whipping up a light and fluffy vanilla meringue to top this delicious pie is sure to wow your Thanksgiving guests. Toasting the meringue with a chef's torch will give your pie some extra color and lovely marshmallow smell. This decadent treat will please in both taste and presentation this holiday season.</p>
        <p>This pie will take a bit longer to make than the average pumpkin pie, since meringue is a step up from whipped cream. But most of the work can be handled by a stand mixer, leaving you to take a break or work on other menu items. This is still a relatively effortless recipe that's sure to wow, and as always, is best served fresh out of the oven.</p>
