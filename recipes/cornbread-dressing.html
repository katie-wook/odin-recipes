        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Cornbread is a family favorite around this time of year. This recipe involves making cornbread and then crumbling it into this dressing. You can make your cornbread from scratch or use a mix from the store - either way, this dish will be simple yet stunning this holiday season.</p>
        <p>This recipe is best served fresh, but can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for three to four days. You can reheat it in the microwave or the oven and can add broth as needed for additional moisture. Be careful not to bake for too long!</p>
